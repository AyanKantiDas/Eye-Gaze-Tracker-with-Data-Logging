# Eye-Gaze-Tracker-with-Data-Logging

An eye gaze tracking application built using Python and OpenCV, which detects facial features and tracks the direction of gaze in real-time. The application logs data, including timestamps, gaze direction, and on-screen status, and saves it in an Excel file for analysis.

<h2>Features</h2>
a. Face and Eye Detection: Utilizes Haar cascades for detecting faces and eyes in real-time.
b. Gaze Direction Analysis: Identifies gaze direction (Left, Right, Up, Down, or Center) and logs whether the user is 
   looking on-screen or off-screen.
c. Data Logging: Saves data into an Excel file, including timestamps, gaze direction, and on-screen status, using the 
   user's name as the file identifier.
d. Real-Time Visualization: Displays the detected face and eyes with bounding boxes on the video feed.
